=head1 NAME

EVP_MD-BLAKE2 - The BLAKE2 EVP_MD implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Support for computing BLAKE2 digests through the B<EVP_MD> API.

=head2 Identities

This implementation is only available with the default provider, and
includes the following varieties:

=over 4

=item BLAKE2S-256

Known names are "BLAKE2S-256" and "BLAKE2s256".

=item BLAKE2B-512

Known names are "BLAKE2B-512" and "BLAKE2b512".

=back

=head2 Gettable Parameters

This implementation supports the common gettable parameters described
in L<EVP_MD-common(7)>.

=head2 Settable Context Parameters

The BLAKE2B-512 implementation supports the following L<OSSL_PARAM(3)> entries,
settable for an B<EVP_MD_CTX> with L<EVP_MD_CTX_set_params(3)>:

=over 4

=item "size" (B<OSSL_DIGEST_PARAM_SIZE>) <unsigned integer>

Sets a different digest length for the L<EVP_DigestFinal(3)> output.
The value of the "size" parameter should not exceed 255 and it must be set
during the L<EVP_DigestInit_ex2(3)> call.
